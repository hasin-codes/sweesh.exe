# Sweesh v1.1.2 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 22, 2025

## üîß Critical Bug Fixes

### Auto-Updater Fix
- **Fixed update installation blocking**: Updates now install correctly without leaving zombie processes
- **Force quit mechanism**: Implemented proper force quit that kills all Electron processes (all 5 tasks) when exiting from system tray
- **Pending update detection**: App now checks for pending installers on startup and installs them automatically
- **Improved cleanup**: Enhanced cleanup routines to ensure all windows and listeners are properly destroyed on exit

### Installation Process
- **Automatic installer launch**: If a pending update is detected in `C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\sweesh-updater\pending\`, the installer launches automatically on next startup
- **Process termination**: All app processes are now properly terminated before update installation begins
- **No manual intervention needed**: Users no longer need to manually end tasks in Task Manager for updates to install

## üéØ Technical Improvements
